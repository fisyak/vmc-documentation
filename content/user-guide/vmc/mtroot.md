Root IO manager class, [TMCRootManager](https://vmc-project.github.io/vmc/classTMCRootManager.html), facilitates use of ROOT IO in VMC examples and it also handles necessary locking in multi-threaded applications.

It was first provided in Geant4 VMC in the MTRoot sub-package and moved to the core VMC library (since vmc 2.0 and geant4_vmc 6.0).
