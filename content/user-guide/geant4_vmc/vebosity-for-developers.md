For many Geant4 VMC classes (like for Geant4 classes) the user can select a higher verbosity level and activate various printings which can help in understanding or debugging his application. Here we list the commands useful rather for Geant4 VMC developers, for the commands useful for users see [Verbosity](/user-guide/geant4_vmc/verbosity).

- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/SDConstruction  2
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print the volumes IDs (implemented via G4VSensitiveDetector objects) and the maps between volumes and volume IDs.

- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/runManager 3
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print the logical volume store.

- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/trackManager 2
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print particleID info from `SetTrackInformation`.

- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/physicsManager 2
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print the parameter name and value from calls to Gstpar. 

- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/particlesManager 2
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print the map between the names of special particles in Root and Geant4 (like geantino, opticalphoton, etc.); print also info about particles and ions defined by user.
    
- {{< highlight bash >}}
/mcVerbose/physicsProcessControlMap 1
/mcVerbose/physicsProcessMCMap 1     
/mcVerbose/physicsStepLimiter 1     
/mcVerbose/physicsUserParticles 1
{{< /highlight >}}
  - Print info about each constructed special process; in case of map processes (physicsProcessControlMap, physicsProcessMCMap) print also whether the mapping was successful (all physics processes in the user physics list were identified in the maps).
