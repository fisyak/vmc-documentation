### Chapter 3.5

# MTRoot

The MTRoot package (since Geant4 VMC 3.00) provides Root IO manager classes which facilitate use of ROOT IO in VMC examples and they also handle  necessary locking in multi-threaded applications. It is independent from Geant4 VMC and it is used in VMC examples. 

See more details in the [MTRoot](http://ivana.home.cern.ch/ivana/mtroot_html/index.html) web page.
