A set of examples of usage of VMC is included in **geant4_vmc**. 

Though provided within Geant4 VMC, they can be built independently and do not require Geant4 installation in case you want to run them with GEANT3 only.

See more details on the [VMC Examples](https://vmc-project.github.io/geant4_vmc/examples_html/) web page.
